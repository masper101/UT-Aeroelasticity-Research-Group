function [vortex_data] = foutlierdetection(vortex_data)
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% This function takes all of the instantaneous vortex positions, size, and
% circulation at certain azimuthal location and arranges them into one
% matrix. Groups or clusters of data are identified from all of the vortex
% center points. Each cluster represents all of the instantaneous points
% found for n*vortices. A outlier detecion algorithm is then used to 
% identify and remove any erroneous data points. This is performed for all 
% azimuthal locations.

% INPUTS:
%        vortex_data (see fVortex_ID)        
%
% OUTPUTS: 
%        The following field is added to vortex_data
%        vortex_data
%           (1) filtered: n x 1 cell array (n = # of azimuthal locations)
%               containing contains all the data points for each vortex
%               found at each azimuthal location. Each cell contains m
%               cells (m = # of vortices in a given flowfield) each with 
%               w x 5 matrices (w = # of vortex locations remaining after
%               outlier detection). The five columns of each matrix are for
%               the following paramters
%                   (a) x-coordinate 
%                   (b) y-coordinate 
%                   (c) core radius 
%                   (d) circulation,
%                   (e) identifier for the flowfield the vortex data was
%                       extracted from.
